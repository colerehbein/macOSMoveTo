# macOSMoveTo
Adds a macOS Quick Action to move files to a specified destination.

After being very disappointed by [this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254648745?sortBy=best), I asked chatGPT to solve the problem. It produced this functioning automation with AppleScript.

To install:
Download and unzip the .zip file and install the workflow into Automator.
